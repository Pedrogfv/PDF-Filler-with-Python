# PDF-Filler-with-Python
Automated filler of PDF´s using python

Automating tasks is something that brings me satisfaction. Everytime I get something to do it by it´s self I just feel intelligent haha.
On my way to keep learning automatiztion tasks with python, now I´m in the need to fill a lot of pdf files. But I´m kinda lazy so instead I´ll do it through a database and a pyuthon code.
I´ll share the progress;)

1. Progres 12/05/2025
I tried filling my PDF format and failled.
Apparently the file was created without structure and it dosen't even have names for de text boxes.
I will try to do it in a more simpler way.

2. Progress 13/05/2025
Now I created a new file with new fillable spaces in this page: https://www.sejda.com/es/pdf-editor
Just to try the Library with a simpler way to fill the document.
It worked great.
Now I´ll modify the original PDF that I wanted to fill in the begining so I can fillit up with info that I have in a samll dictionary for trials before moving on to the whole database.
